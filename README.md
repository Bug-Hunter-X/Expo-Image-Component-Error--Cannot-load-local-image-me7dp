This repository demonstrates a common error when using Expo's `Image` component with local images and provides a solution. The error typically manifests as a missing or broken image in the app.

## Problem
The `Image` component fails to load a local image due to an incorrectly formatted or inaccessible URI.  This can be caused by various factors, including incorrect file paths, missing image files, case sensitivity issues, and permission problems.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully verifying the image URI, ensuring the image file exists, handling case sensitivity, and addressing any permission issues that might be preventing access to the image.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to launch the Expo development server.
