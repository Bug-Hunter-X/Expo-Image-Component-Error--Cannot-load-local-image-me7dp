To fix this, ensure the image is properly accessible.  Use the `require` method instead of a URI if the image is part of your project.

**Correct method (if image is in the project's assets):**
```javascript
import myImage from './assets/images/my-image.jpg';

<Image source={myImage} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}/>
```

**Correct method (using a properly formatted URI):**
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'file:///path/to/your/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```

**Explanation of changes:**

* Using `require` directly imports the image.  This is the preferred method if the image is within the project.
* Using `file:///` ensures that the correct file system access method is used.

**Debugging steps:**

1. **Verify the image path:** Double-check the file path is correct, including capitalization.
2. **Check for the file:**  Confirm the image file exists at the specified location.
3. **Check file permissions:**  Ensure your application has the necessary permissions to access the image.
4. **Console log:** Add a `console.log(uri)` to check the path your using in your Image component and compare to the physical path of your image file. 
5. **Try copying the image into the project's assets folder** and using the `require` method.
