This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local image URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  The URI might be incorrect, the image file might be missing, or there might be permission issues preventing Expo from accessing the image.

**Example of incorrect URI:**
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'path/to/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}/>
```

**Possible issues:**
* **Incorrect path:** Double-check that the file path is correct relative to your project's assets directory.
* **Missing file:** Ensure the image file actually exists at the specified location.
* **Case sensitivity:** Filenames and paths are case-sensitive on some systems.
* **Permissions:** If the image is located outside of your app's accessible directories, you might need to adjust file permissions or use a different method to access it (like copying the image to a location within your project).
* **Incorrect file extension:** The file extension might be wrong, causing the image not to load properly.
